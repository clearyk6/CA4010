## Project

Report and Dataset based on Workshops. Generate your own dataset (using web scrape) or use an online dataset. Can use Classification, Clustering or Association Rule Mining.

- BCA for getting rid of attributes.. make sure to keep important ones, but too many attributes is detrimental.
- GROUP 49 for project reference.
- Workshop presentation submissions close at 11p.m on Monday night.

### Report Structure

- Slide 1: Idea and dataset description
- Slide 2: Data Preparation (from your Workshop presentation)
- Slide 3: Algorithm description
- Slide 4: Results and Analysis (insights) about what you found

Method: 25%, Dataset Prep: 25%, Experiments, Eval, Analysis: 50%
